    <h2>Origin Story</h2>
    <p>A young lad with the birthname of Timothey Michael Jackson Clarke was born in Ferndale, Washington on the 243rd day of the year 2000. Throughout his entire life he had issues finding stuff he thought was "interesting". Until one day when he watched a little thing called a movie. He realized he really liked movies like Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift. It was this day that he pledged himself to Eastern Washington University (mostly because it was the only college who accepted him).</p>
    
    <h2>Super Power</h2>
